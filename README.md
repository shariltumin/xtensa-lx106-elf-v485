# xtensa-lx106-elf-v485
xtensa toolchain v 4.8.5 for ESP8266. This is necessary if you want to build MicroPython firmware for the ESP8266.

You will receive the following error:
```
xtensa-lx106-elf-gcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-mforce-l32';
```
This will happen if you try using a newer version (e.g., 8.4.0).
